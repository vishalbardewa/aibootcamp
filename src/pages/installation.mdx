# Installation

This guide will get you all set up and ready to use Python. We'll cover how to get started using one of our API clients and how to make your first API request. We'll also look at where to go next to find all the information you need to take full advantage of our powerful REST API. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<Note>
  Make sure to check the minimum system configuration required for the installation of latest stable Python version. We will be using Python 3 for this bootcamp

## Installing locally

The general steps to install Python locally on your machine. The exact steps may vary slightly depending on your operating system. We'll cover installations for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

### Windows:
1. **Download Python**:
- Visit the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/).
- Navigate to the "Downloads" section.
- Click on the "Latest Python 3.x Release" link.
- Scroll down to the "Files" section, and download the installer for Windows.

2. **Run the Installer**:
- Once the installer is downloaded, double-click on it to run.
- Check the box that says "Add Python 3.x to PATH" during the installation.
- Click "Install Now" to start the installation.

3. **Verify Installation**:
- Open a command prompt (search for "cmd" in the Start menu).
- Type ```python --version``` or ```python -V``` and press Enter. You should see the installed Python version.

<Note>
Here are the resources to install on [Linux](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/linux/) and [macOS](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/osx/).

These instructions covers the basic steps for installing Python. Depending on your needs, you might also want to explore virtual environments to manage Python packages and dependencies for different projects.

## Using online cloud service

Here is the preferred way for learning the fundamentals of Python. Without dealing with the overheads of local installation and getting started right away we can make use of [replit.com](https://replit.com/), it is an online collabarative coding environment where you can collabarate with people for coding and is a good way to practice.

Please mind that this is just for learning Python and not for production grade application. You would need a Github or Google account to sign up and get started.

- Login with your Github/Google account
- Do an SSO using your preferred on [replit](https://replit.com/)
